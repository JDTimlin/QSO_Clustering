For instructions on how to run this code, see the README files within the classification/ and clustering/ folders respectively.

Those files will instruct you on how to reproduce the plots from Timlin et al. 2018, as well as direct you to relevant data files.

The final Clustering Data Set can be found in the following directory:

./clustering/Data_Sets/HZLZ_combined_all_hzclassifiers_wphotoz_zspecflg.fits

and the randoms can be found here:

./clustering/Data_Sets/Short_randoms_spsh.fits

The pair counts results can be found here:

./clustering/Compute_correlation2/Final_Clustering_All.txt

and the jackknife set:
